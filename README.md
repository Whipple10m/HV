# Purdue HV system

Unfortunately I do not have the code for the Purdue HV system, written by Rod Lessard. All that is here is a screenshot from circa 1999.

*Note:* The HV system normally ported the logo of the "Purdue Boilermakers", which was a train. For a number of years Rod and I battleed over control of this logo in the GUI, I replaced it with the logo of "Thomas The Tank Engine" whenever I recompiled the GUI. Rod would replace the correct Boilermaker logo when he updated the code. However, since I lived in Arizona I usually won the war, and Thomas was frequently visible on the GUI, as can be seen in this screenshot.
